# Language Bias English Native
The following app is a modification of the EdX app for testing the language bias experiment on English native-speakers.

For quick extension, most names have been left unaltered. In particular, the agl task has been re-written to be the forward backward bias task originally written by WJ as LBC. The database is still to be named edx.db, but there is new blank database with updated tables for the agl in the resources folder.

# TODO
* Confirm subject id format
* Confirm agl data items
