The StefanFrank.stimuli.txt file contains the original txt file with sentences used by Stefan Frank.
The sents.json file contains those sentences parsed into JSON objects for use in the experiment.
The file is a single array of JSON objects, where each object contains a sentence [ {},{},{} ]
Each JSON sentence object is composed of { "sent":"<string containing sentence for display>" "question":"<string of y/n question to be asked after the sentence; leave the string empty, i.e. "", if you do not want a question>", "answer":"<either y or n for the correct answer to the question if you had one, again, leave as empty string if there is no question>"}
